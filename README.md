# Tapper
Tapper is my very first app in Objective-C, as I am ramping up on this programming language.  
It includes very basic functionalities to hide and display IBOutlets based on IBActions, and modify variables values.  
The app itself does not provide much:
- a user enters a number and click play
- next a buzzer is presented and the user is invited to press it the same number of times than its previous input

## Credit
This app is the result of a learning exercice from the [Devslopes Objective-C Crash Course for Swift Developers][1] available on Udemy. Visual assets were provided by Devslopes as part of a Swift project that I had to convert into Objective-C.
